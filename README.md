# manualCyborgPreprocessing
A collection of scripts and guides to complement fs2CyborgPreprocessing.

* Offline preprocessing: Count peaks in action potentials in 6 second 80 % overlapping sliding window of PSDs on noise reduced wave files. Description of procedure in offlineCyborgPreprocessing/README.md .
* Scripts to create noise tresholds used in fs2CyborgPreprocessing. Description of procedure in computeNoiseTresholdsForUseInfs2CyborgPreprocessing/README.md .
